                <p>My Mushu Pakhi,

                    This Valentineâ€™s Day feels different. Not because my love for you has changed, 
                    but because we stand at a place where love is not just about being togetherâ€”itâ€™s about cherishing what we have, no matter where life takes us. <br>
                    
                    For the past five years, you have been my best friend, my safe place, and the kind of love that stories fail to capture. 
                    We built something rareâ€”something deeper than just romance. And no matter what happens, I want you to know this: 
                    You will always hold a place in my heart that no one can replace. <br>
                    
                    Love isnâ€™t always about forever in the way the world expects it to be. Sometimes, love is about finding a person who changes you in ways you never imagined, 
                    who teaches you what it means to truly care, to truly understand. You have been that person for me. <br>
                    
                    You are my soulmate. Not just because we connect deeply, but because a soulmate is someone who makes you feel understood in ways no one else can. 
                    Itâ€™s that person who walks through life with you, who brings out the best parts of you, who makes you feel truly seen. You have been that for me, 
                    and Iâ€™ve been that for you. Itâ€™s a bond that goes beyond time, beyond distance.

        <p>I am still mad at you, and the most infuriating thing isâ€”you donâ€™t even know why!!! So let me tell you, you dumb bitch! <br> 

            Last night, when I called you and asked you to sing for me (obviously so that I could bully you), after insisting a million times, you still didnâ€™t. YOU DIDNâ€™T. 
            First of all, how dare you!!! I expect my man to kiss the ground I walk onâ€”nothing less than that. And you couldnâ€™t even sing two lines?!
            
            ON TOP OF THAT, you had the audacity to say, "What if I don't sing? Emon toh na je tumi breakup kore felba, eventually toh tumi e call diba." really <br> 
            
            The audacity!!! Huh! <br>
            
            So donâ€™t even flatter yourself, thinking I made this project for you. I made it for me!! oiwehfowehfeoiwhf ughhhhh . Got it? I did this to learn coding. 
            Iâ€™ve made progress so far, but I still need to study more. Then Iâ€™ll move on to the next part. Whatever.
            
            Now, go to the next slide to see what will happen if you continue to hurt me like this. </p>
